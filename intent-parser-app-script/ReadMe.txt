This directory contains the Google App script.  Currently, since it is
not yet released on the Google App Store, the app script needs to be
manually installed on a document.  To install the app script on a
Google Document, first select "Script Editor" from the Document's
"Tools" menu.  This should bring up the Script Editor web interface.
Paste the contents of Code.js into the Script Editor window.  The
first line in Code.js specifies the URL of the Intent Parser Server.
